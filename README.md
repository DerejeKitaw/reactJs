> Create TWO new components: UserInput and UserOutput

UserInput.js

UserOutput.js

> Pass a username (of your choice) to UserOutput via props and display it there

App.js
> Output multiple UserOutput components in the App component (any paragraph texts of your choice)
> Add state to the App component (=> the username) and pass the username to the UserOutput component
>Add a method to manipulate the state (=> an event-handler method)
> Pass the event-handler method reference to the UserInput component and bind it to the input-change event
