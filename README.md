# Building Redirect
> The Redirect component is a cousin of Link. Whereas 
* `Link` produces a link that the user can click on to modify the location, 
* `Redirect` will immediately modify the location whenever it is rendered. 

>Like Link, we’ll expect this component to be supplied with a to prop. And, like Link, we’ll grab history from context and use that object to modify the browser’s location.
